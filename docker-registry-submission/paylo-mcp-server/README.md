# Paylo MCP Server

The **Paylo MCP Server** is a bridge that empowers AI models (like Claude, GPT-4) to interact with the real-world commerce ecosystem of Paylo.

By adding this server to your AI agent's context, you transform it from a text processor into a **capable shopping assistant** that can browse storefronts, find products, and facilitate transactions across the Paylo network.

## Capabilities

- **Merchant Discovery:** Find active storefronts based on categories or names.
- **Product Search:** Semantic and keyword search across the entire Paylo product catalog.
- **Product Details:** Retrieve rich metadata, pricing, and availability for specific items.
- **Cart Management:** intelligently build orders with multiple items.
- **Checkout:** Generate secure **Paystack** payment links for users to complete purchases.
- **Order Tracking:** Check the real-time status of payments and orders.
